This is the version of my code that got me the highest score of 73 for the assessment.

While this position is a Typescript-focused role, I chose Go for the assessment to demonstrate my ability in building backend services that complement a TypeScript frontend. I specifically wanted to leverage Go's native ability to handle concurrent network requests and its strict type system to manage the API's data and rate-limiting requirements.
